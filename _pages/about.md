From July 2023 to now, Beijing Digital Native Digital City Research Center, Head of Frontier Technology Exploration Departmentï¼Œsenior algorithm expert
Research area:
1. Spatial MLLM: 3D spatial scene understanding, spatial editing, spatial measurement and spatial positioning.
2. Controllable generation of 3D scene: multi-modal controlled 3D scene diffusion model.
3. Large model Agent: spatio-temporal multi-agent architecture, spatial analysis, time series analysis and other space task analysis and planning.
4. Embodied navigation: a large model environment perception modeling and navigation planning agent based on Yushu Go2 mechanical dog is built, a real-sim-real fast training process based on the actual environment is built, and the end-side calculation of large model algorithm Go2 is realized.
